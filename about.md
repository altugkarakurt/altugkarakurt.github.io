I am an electrical and computer engineer, currently working at DAtAnchor as a software developer. We are cyber-security company, building variety of data security solutions.

Prior to joining DAtAnchor, I received my MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering from The Ohio State University in 2018 and my BS in Electrical & Electronics Enginnering from Bilkent University in 2016. My research interests include information theory, multi-armed bandit problems, communication networks and applied machine learning. I received the Best Paper Award from WiOpt 2018.

During my graduate studies, I worked as a member of Information Processing Systems Lab and conducted research on multi-user communication networks and more specifically on multi-station detection problem. I have also been working on multi-armed bandit problem's extensions such as combinatorial, contextual and active learning settings, as well as its applications to communication networks and social networks.

I spend most of my free time watching/playing basketball and listening to music. I used to write a <a href="http://bilnews.bilkent.edu.tr/?s=altug+karakurt" target="_blank">biweekly music columns</a> for my undergraduate university's newspaper and I recently started publishing music reviews on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRkrTes-4DpenIJWNA2OpA" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>.
