I am an electrical and computer engineer, working on cyber-security solutions in DAtAnchor. Prior to joining OSU, I received my MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering from The Ohio State University in 2018 and my BS in Electrical & Electronics Enginnering from Bilkent University in 2016. During my graduate studies, I worked as a member of <a href="http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/ips/home/" target="_blank">Information Processing Systems Lab</a>, working under the supervision of <a href="http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~eryilmaz/" target="_blank">Atilla Eryilmaz</a> and <a href="http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~koksal/" target="_blank">C. Emre Koksal</a>.

I am an avid Python programmer, who tries to learn the intricacies of the language and to stay up-to-date with available libraries. I have been using Python for over 6 years for various tasks that vary from web development to machine learning applications. I am also comfortable programming with C++ and Java. You can find some of my implementations on <a href="http://github.com/altugkarakurt/" target="_blank">my Github page</a>. Unfortunately, most of my programming is on confidential corporate projects and is not publicly visible. 

I spend most of my free time discovering and listening to music. I used to write a <a href="http://bilnews.bilkent.edu.tr/?s=altug+karakurt" target="_blank">biweekly music column</a> for my undergraduate university's newspaper and I recently started publishing music reviews on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRkrTes-4DpenIJWNA2OpA" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>.
